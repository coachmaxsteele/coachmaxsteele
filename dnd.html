        <h3>I. Structure</h3>
        <p>
          This will be an OPEN TABLE, drop-in campaign. This means that each session will contain a starting and stopping point allowing players to attend sessions as they can.
          For a player, missing a session will not hamper the other players, and there will be no expectation that anyone attend every session.

          The campaign may be run at multiple locations for different groups whose players never actually meet but, because it is a persistent world, their actions will affect one another.

          There is *no expectation* that you attend every, or even the majority of sessions. Play as you can. This is a *game* and the chief goal is fun.

          I will try to run a session every week if possible. Saturdays seem most likely, but there is ample room for adjustment to varying schedules.
          I will run sessions when the most players are available, occasionally having small sessions for those with less favorable schedules.

        <h3>II. System</h3>
        <p>
          We will be using Old School Essentials: Advanced Fantasy - which is a retro clone of Basic/Expert D&D with some of the AD&D character options added in.
          If you have never played early D&D, you’re in for a treat.
          Here is a summary of concepts on classic D&D from the days of Google+:
          <ol>
            <li>This is a game about interacting with this world as if it were a place that exists.</li>
            <li>Killing things is not the goal.</li>
            <li>There is nothing that is “supposed” to happen.</li>
            <li>Unknowability and consequence make everything interesting.</li>
            <li>You play as your character, not as the screenwriter writing your character.</li>
            <li>It’s your job to make your character interesting and to make the game interesting for you.</li>
            <li>If you find yourself in a fair fight, your tactics suck.</li>
            <li>The answer is not on your character sheet.</li>
            <li>Things are swingy.</li>
            <li>You will die.</li>
          </ol>
        You are expected to buy NOTHING. I will provide rulebooks, dice (if needed), and anything else you may need to play.

          <h3>III. Table Rules</h3>
          <p>
            *A.* D&D can have a high fatality rate for characters, especially at lower levels. In this game, you *will* see characters die. Be prepared for this, and don't bring characters to the table whose lives you are not willing to risk. I will not soften blows, or nudge dice in your favor. The risk of death is what makes your characters' accomplishments and your choices matter. I am rooting for you, but I am not here to insure that you win. If you have concerns about this aspect of the game hampering your fun, please let me know. I can speak at length about this issue. Otherwise, I encourage everyone to give it a shot. Remember, your choices only matter
            when there are actual stakes and multiple possible outcomes.

            *B.* Please refrain from excessive "table chatter" if you can. Talking at length about *off topic* issues at the table slows down play and tends to drown out the quieter players who are actually interested in playing, but can't get a word in edgewise. You don't have to use "silly" voices or become totally immersed in your characters (although it's completely encouraged), but when you're dragging the whole group out of the game, it defeats the point of even playing. I'm not asking anyone to sit in
            silence, but maybe that 5 minute story about an internet argument can wait until a
            break?

            *C.* The Dungeon Master (DM hereafter) is final arbitrator of conflicts. I follow the "rulings, not rules" philosophy in games I'm running. We are all at the table to have fun and tell a story, but at the end of the day, it is my decision that breaks ties. *Please* feel free to challenge a ruling, but if it's a conversation that will slow down play, we should talk about it during a break or after the session. This hasn't been an issue in the
            past, but for new players it's worth saying. Have faith in the fact that I'm not petty, cruel, or "out to get you."

          </p>

        <div class="one-half column">
          <h3>IV. Character Creation</h3>
          <p>
            *Don't* come to the table with a bunch of character concepts! For the first session, each player will pick 2-4 randomly generated villagers. (yes that's 2-4 characters per player) These villagers are about to take their
            first (and perhaps last) steps down the life path of an adventurer. *IF*they survive the first adventure, they might go on to become warriors, thieves, clerics, or wizards.

            Why would such mundane folk leave the comforts of their village for such a risky life? Because there are no comforts in their village. This word lives under feudalism! They're peasants or lower in most cases. They're never going to "move up in the world" being a pig farmer or a tanner. Adventuring, dungeon delving, piracy, mercenary work, and other "unsavory" professions provide the promise of fame and riches. Upward mobility is
            their likely goal! It's *beyond* reckless to crawl down into a monster infested tunnel looking for gold and gems. Who, but the foolish and desperate would even try?

            This is what your characters are. Foolish or desperate. Perhaps both.

            Once you have your character sheets, give them names, dreams, motivations. Just because they'll likely die doesn't mean that they never lived.
