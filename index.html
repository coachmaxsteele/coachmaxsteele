        <h3>2. Nutrition Coaching</h3>
        <p>
          Science-backed, results-oriented nutrition planning doesn’t have to be alienating or miserable.
          In fact, it shouldn't be.
          Individual Initiative helps people build enjoyable, realistic nutrition skills so they can stop stressing about food and focus on life's other essentials.
          My current Nutrition Coaching package consists of:
          - 1x Weekly Video/Phone Check-in & - Goal Setting
          - Meal Journaling
          - Habit Building
          - Extra Homework as Needed

        <h3>3. Play</h3>
        <p>
          Play is a need; a crucial building block of any full, healthy life.
          I've played Dungeon & Dragons (and other role-playing games) since I was 12.
          This life-long hobby informs much of what I do as a trainer & coach.
          <a href="https://www.katielear.com/child-therapy-blog/2020/5/20/dungeons-and-dragons-as-therapy-mental-health">Here</a>
          are <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/how-playing-dungeons-dragons-has-helped-me-be-more-connected-creative-and-compassionate/">just</a>
          a <a href="https://juliastamman.com/2019/03/01/dungeons-and-dragons-benefits/">few</a> of the many arguments in favor of playing D&D as a child or adult.
          I want you to play D&D - but that's because I love it and it's improved ==my== life.
          Play whatever/however you want - but ==play==!
          Mix physical, mental, & social play ==each week==. Different ratios will allow for adequate recovery.
          Ex:
          - Playing in a weekly D&D game ***(mental/social)***
          - Going to the climbing gym w/ a partner ***(physical/social)***
          - Learning to juggle ***(physical/mental)***
          Don't treat play as training. Your hobbies are something you're allowed to be "mediocre" at. That's part of the fun. If you're chasing excellence - that's training - and you need a healthy mix of both.

          There is no substitute for experience on the floor with clients.
          All the studying, writing, podcasting, and time in the gym is never going to replace real training experience.
          I've been at this a few years, and I feel confident in my abilities as a trainer. But I've also got a long way to go. My heroes have been doing their thing for <strong>decades</strong>.
          That's not me. Yet.
          The experience point bar above represents 10,000 training hours.
          The best minds in this field have filled their bars - and they're <strong>still</strong> learning new things. That's my goal.
          But, because certifications exist, and you might want some indication I'm qualified to work with you - I currently hold:
        </p>
        <table class="u-full-width">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Certification</th>
              <th>Source</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td>Personal Trainer</td><td>NASM</td></tr>

          If you really want to know whether I'm worth your time - take a look at my [testimonials](#testimonials) instead. Getting results with clients is a far better indicator.
